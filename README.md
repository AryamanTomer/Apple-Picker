# Apple-Picker
This is my first Game in Unity

The objective of the game is to score and collect as many apples as possible to get the Highest Score

There is a Tree that drops 3 different kinds of Apples - Red Apple, Golden Apple, and a Poison Apple

The Red Apple gives you 100 points
The Yellow Apple gives you 200 points
The Poison Apple takes away 50 points.

You have 3 lives that are represented by the lower 3 baskets

In order to keep these lives, you must collect every poison apple and not let them fall

If you do, you go back to the main menu.

The Game is in the Master Branch
